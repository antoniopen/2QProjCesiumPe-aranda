       <h2>What is Formula One?</h2>
       <p>If there’s one word to describe it, it would definitely be fast. Formula One, also known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international auto racing for single seater cars. Since its inaugural season in 1950, it has continued to be the premier and top league of motorsport for seventy-one years and running. Every tiny aspect of the sport is designed to go a few milliseconds quicke. It stands at the technological pinnacle of all of motorsport. Not only is it the space for the best drivers in the world, but also the space for the best engineers and car designers. It’s ruthless, gritty, and most of all, entertaining.  Formula One is high octane racing at its absolute finest, and after more than 1,000 races, it has never been more alive.</p>

      <h2 id="special_header">Why get up to speed with Formula One?</h2>
      <p>In a way, it’s just brilliant. It’s properly brilliant, regardless if you like racing or not. It’s the fastest, the biggest, and the best. Nothing is faster than an F1 car around a track, and nothing is as big as it is. Formula One is a racing spectacle that’s amazing to watch both on track and in the garages. The races can leave you on the edge of your seat, and the dramatic rivalries that form are just very entertaining to watch. Not only that, but the history of the sport itself is fascinating to read through. F1 traces its roots all the way back to the start of racing. Without it, there would be no other motorsports today. And no other competition has the same rich tradition and group of names. Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Senna, Schumacher, Hamilton. These titans of the sport, and many more, make up only a part of this magnificent and grandiose sport’s history.</p>
